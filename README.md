 - select the tab `animations.js`

## How to change the code?

  - First look at the instructions on [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/learn/) and understand how p5js works. You can also look at the [CODE! Youtube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) playlist.

  - Only **after** that do you start changing the local code in `animations.js`.

  - Start by changing one of the `Tx_xxxx` timing parameters in the top of the file and press run (>). See what happend. Changing the timings is changing the user interaction and usability.

  - Next change some of the colors using color names or RGB values. Changing the colors is mostly changing the user experience.

 - Finally you can change the code that takes care of the anmations. For example change the 12 into 24 or 36 and observe what happens when you run it. Changing the colors is changing the user interaction, usability and user experience.

## Advanced changes

 - You can also open the file `donald_20201_local.js` and look for the function `buttons(...)`. There you can change the look of the buttons by changing the code.

## Tips

  - Turn on the inspector in your browser. Then you can see some of the print statements.

  - To look at the program on your mobile phone, find out the IP number in the Network settings of your laptop.
   Next enter the URL you see in the browser of your laptop, something like `http://127.0.0.1:nnnn`, into the browser on your phone. Replacing the `127.0.0.1`with the IP number op your laptop you found earlier. Your laptop will act as the server for your mobile phone.
