## How to change the code?

  - First look at the instructions on [p5js.org](https://p5js.org/learn/) and understand how p5js works.

  - Only **after** that do you start changing the local code.

  - Start by chnaging one of the `Tx_xxxx` timing parameters in the top of the file and press run (>). See what happend. Changing the timings is changing the user interaction and usability.
